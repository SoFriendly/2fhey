# 2FHey

Automatically detect and copy verification codes from iMessage and SMS.

## Features

- üîê Automatic OTP detection from messages
- üìã Auto-copy to clipboard
- ‚å®Ô∏è Optional auto-paste
- üîî Desktop notifications
- üéØ Global keyboard shortcut (‚áß‚åòE) to resync messages
- üåê Support for 145+ services

## How It Works

2FHey uses smart keyword-based detection to identify verification code messages. When a message contains words like "verification", "code", "OTP", "PIN", etc., it automatically:

1. Extracts 4-8 digit codes (or alphanumeric codes)
2. Identifies the service (Google, Apple, Bank, etc.)
3. Copies the code to your clipboard
4. Shows a notification overlay
5. Optionally auto-pastes the code

## Supported Formats

The app automatically detects codes in various formats:
- Standard digits: `123456`
- Spaced/dashed: `123-456` or `123 456`
- Alphanumeric: `ABC123`, `X7Y9Z2`
- Google format: `G-12345`
- Chinese brackets: `„ÄêÈ™åËØÅÁ†Å123456„Äë`

## Installation

1. Download from [2fhey.com](https://2fhey.com) (via Gumroad)
2. Move to Applications folder
3. Launch and grant required permissions:
   - **Full Disk Access** - to read Messages database
   - **Accessibility** - for auto-paste and keyboard shortcuts

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **‚áß‚åòE** (Shift + Command + E) - Resync messages and copy the latest OTP code to clipboard
  - Useful if 2FHey missed a message or you need to retrieve a recent code again
  - Can be disabled in Settings if it conflicts with other apps

## Custom Services

If you use a service that isn't automatically recognized, you can add it to the known services list by creating a PR to update `OTPParserConstants.knownServices` in `TwoFHey/OTPParser/OTPParserContants.swift`.

## Multi-Language Support

2FHey supports OTP detection in multiple languages including English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Chinese. The language files are automatically updated from GitHub without requiring a new app release.

### How It Works

The app uses a three-tier loading strategy:

1. **First launch:** Loads from bundled language files and custom patterns (immediate availability)
2. **Subsequent launches:** Loads from cached files (fast)
3. **Background update:** Fetches latest from GitHub on each app launch

Files are fetched from:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoFriendly/2fhey/main/TwoFHey/OTPKeywords/{language}.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoFriendly/2fhey/main/TwoFHey/OTPKeywords/custom-patterns.json
```

### Adding a New Language

To add support for a new language:

1. Create a new JSON file in `TwoFHey/OTPKeywords/` with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "keywords": [
       "code",
       "verification",
       "verify"
     ],
     "patterns": [
       "code[\\s:]+([\\d\\s-]{4,8})",
       "verification[\\s:]+([\\d\\s-]{4,8})"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Add the filename to the `languageFiles` array in `SimpleOTPParser.swift:22`

3. Submit a pull request

4. All users will receive the new language support on their next app launch (no binary update required!)

### Adding Custom Service Patterns

For services with unique OTP formats (like Chase, Geico, etc.), you can add patterns to `TwoFHey/OTPKeywords/custom-patterns.json`:

```json
{
  "customPatterns": [
    {
      "service": "YourService",
      "pattern": "YourService code: (\\d{6})"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pattern tips:**
- Use capture groups `()` to extract the code
- First capture group will be used as the OTP code
- Service name is automatically associated with the pattern
- Patterns are checked first (highest priority)

Custom patterns are also updated remotely from GitHub on app launch.

### Language File Format

Each language file contains:

- **keywords**: An array of words that indicate an OTP message (e.g., "code", "verification", "v√©rification")
  - All keywords from all languages are merged and checked together
  - This allows detection of multilingual messages

- **patterns**: An array of regex patterns for language-specific code extraction
  - These are high-priority patterns like `"È™åËØÅÁ†ÅÔºö123456"` or `"code: 123456"`
  - Pattern captures should extract just the numeric code in capture group 1
  - Patterns are checked before generic digit extraction

### Cache Location

Downloaded language files and custom patterns are cached at: `~/Library/Caches/OTPKeywords/`

### Offline Support

If GitHub is unreachable, the app automatically falls back to:
1. Cached files from previous downloads
2. Bundled files included in the app

## Development Notes

**Version 2.0+** uses a simplified keyword-based OTP parser (`SimpleOTPParser.swift`) instead of complex regex patterns. This makes the app more reliable and easier to maintain.

The old regex-based system (`AppConfig.json` and 130+ service patterns) has been deprecated in favor of smart detection that works with any service.
